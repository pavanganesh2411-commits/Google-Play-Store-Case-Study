# Google-Play-Store-Case-Study
## Problem Statement

The team at **Google Play Store** aims to develop a feature that enhances the visibility of the most promising applications on the platform. To achieve this, a preliminary analysis is required to understand the key factors that define a **well-performing app**.

This analysis seeks to explore relationships between various app attributes and performance metrics by addressing the following questions:

- Does a higher **app size** or **price** necessarily indicate better app performance?
- Does a higher number of **installs** provide a clear indication of better **user ratings** compared to other apps?

Understanding these relationships will help identify the attributes that contribute most significantly to app success and support data-driven feature development.
